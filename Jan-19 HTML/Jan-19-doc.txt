----------------------------------CLASSES------------------------------------

-->Classes simply make it easier to implement inheritance and to create objects based on blueprints.
-->In ES6 creating a class and reading a class is easier.We have to make a constructor of a class using constructor keyword.
-->We can add static methods to the class. and static methods are the methods that are simple attached to the class but not 
   inherited by the class instances.
-->Class definition are not hoisted.
-->We can only add methods to classes but not properties.


--------------------------------INHERITANCE---------------------------------

-->In ES5, we can inherite the another class using parentClass.call().
-->In ES6, we can inherite the another class using super();
-->In ES5, if we want to inherite the protoptype of parent class then we have to use Object.create().
-->In ES6, we can inherite all the properties and prototypes of parent class using super() in the constructor of child class.
