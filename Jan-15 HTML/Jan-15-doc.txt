--------------------OBJECT----------------------

-->In JavaScript, everything is an object. But not 100% are object.
-->Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null are primitives and everything else like 
   Arrays, functions, Objects, Dates, Wrapper for numbers,Strings and Booleans are objects.
-->The constructor in JavaScript is act like a blueprint and is used to create instances which are 
   also objects.
-->JavaScript is a prototype based language which means inheritance is used by something called prototypes.
-->Each and every JavaScript object has a protoptype property which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript.
-->Null ha no prototype and this is the final chain in prototype chain.

-->Every JavaScript Object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript.

-->The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects
   to inherit.

-->The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the constructor itself, it's the prototype
   of all instances that are created through it.

-->When a certain method/property is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found 
   the search moves on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found:prototype chain.



--------------------------CONSTRUCTOR-----------------------

-->With the new keyword empty object is created.
-->Console is very useful to visualize the prototype chain.
-->We can create an object using Object.create().


------------------------FUNCTION-----------------------------

-->Functions are also objects.We can do the same thing with functions which we are doing with objectes.
-->A function is an instance of the Object type.
-->A function behaves like any other object.
-->We can store functions in a variable.
-->We can pass a function as an argument to another function.
-->We can return a function from a function.
-->When we pass another function  as an argument in the function then that function which is passes to the 
   argument is called the callback function.
